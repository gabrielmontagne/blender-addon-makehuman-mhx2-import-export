= Makehuman / Makewalk import export on (as of today's) modern 2.80 Blender

For those, who like me, are trying to piece it together and wished someone had somehow solved it before.

To install (on a checked out version of Makehuman (`https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman`)),
Link the `9_export_mhx2` its plugins folder,

On mine, for example, it looks like this,

----
(base) gabriel@timeo:~/Documents/makehuman/makehuman/plugins$ ls -l 9_export_mhx2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 gabriel gabriel 81 May 11 16:32 9_export_mhx2 -> /home/gabriel/Documents/blender-addon-makehuman-mhx2-import-export/9_export_mhx2/
----

And then link (`ln -s`) each of the folders in `exjerto` to your `~/.config/blender/2.80/scripts/addons` folder.
